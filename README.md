Found out my dead simple site has the yaml Rails vulnerability, do I:

A: Bump the Rails version, deploy and go watch some Netflix
B: Embark on an exercise in yak shaving

As you are reading this and the repo doesn't look like a Rails project I guess you can guess what happened; I had a great night learning about things that I've been meaning to have a look at for the longest of times.
